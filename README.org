#+TITLE: Event-driven serverless function for object detection

* Introduction
This is a function that receives  =CloudEvent= whose body is a JSON that has all the information needed to:
 - Download an image
 - Process the image using a YOLOv3 model
 - Upload the results to a server

This code uses a modification of embed Tomcat to ease the development of event driven functions (see [[[https://github.com/jgutie2r/tomcat]])

The code is not fully functional, there are two methods in ObjectDetectCloudEventListener that must be implemented:
 - =downloadResource=
 - =uploadResults=
